Hello there!

I am a software engineer and full stack web developer currently specializing in automated services and web infrastructure through C#, but I also dabble in plenty of other things such as AI. I am 16 year old in the UK who has been engaging in CS and programming since I was 10 years old and I am currently working on my personal projects (which are mostly private) a couple hours a day, but I do occasionally work on my publicized projects and I plan to expand my repository list with more open source projects.

I do not make money from any of my works and I do not currently do software engineering as a freelancer or for any sort of monetary gain. All of my open source projects are out of passion.

If you would like to contact me, by all means:
